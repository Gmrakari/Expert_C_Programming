typedef int x[10] and #define x int[10]

Look:

#define peach int 
unsigned peach i; /* work */

typedef int banana;
unsigned banana i; /* illegal */


a typedef'd name provides the type for every declarator in a declaration

#define int_ptr int *
int_ptr chalk,cheese;

afer macro expansion,the second line effectively becomes:
int * chalk,cheese;

typedef char * char_ptr;
char_ptr Bentley,Rolls_Royce;
