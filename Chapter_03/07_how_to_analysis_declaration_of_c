char * const *(*next)();

"next is a pointer to a function returning a pointer-to-char" 


char *(* c[10])(int **p)

"the array c is a pointer to a function which has an int type pointer to pointer
parameter returning a pointer-to-char"


Second understand:

"a pointer of the c array to a function taking an int pointer to pointer argument

and returning a pointer-to-char"

Answer:

"c is an array[0..9] of pointer to a function returning a pointer-to-char"

the fuctions pointed to in the array take a pointer to a pointer as their one and
only parameter
